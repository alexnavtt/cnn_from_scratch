# cnn_from_scratch
A hobby attempt to create a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification from scratch in C++.
As a challenge I'm not allowed to use anything but the c++ standard library, so no Eigen, no Boost, no third party CNN libraries.
It's not implemented yet, but if I ever get there I consider CUDA to be a language and not a library, so it's fair game.
May the odds be ever in my favour.
